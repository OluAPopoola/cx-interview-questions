Care was taken to make as few assumptions as possible in the coding of this exercise
But some still exist.

The store items catalogue was hard coded. Normally this would be a dynamic lookup
This code was written to allow for 2 types of offers to be specified
(1) Where there is a discount (integer) on a product which is applied irrespective of number of items bought
(2) The conditional BOGOF offer version which is represented by a string containing 2 numbers e.g '1 1' means
    buy one get one free
    '2 1' represents buy two and get one free
